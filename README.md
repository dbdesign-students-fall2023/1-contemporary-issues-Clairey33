# Contemporary Issues In Data
In an era where data and its application is gaining more edge, the practice of web scraping has emerged as both a powerful tool to fuel the progress while engering many debates. In this document, I explore the topic of the appropriate use of data scraping under different circumstances. The two articles presented, though not in direct contrast, offer different perspectives on this practice.

## Article 1
In a Wired article titled [_ChatGPT Has a Big Privacy Problem_](https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/) published in April of this year, the author takes a critical view of OpenAI's practice of data scraping, especially when personal data is involved.

The article highlights the concerns of Italian regulators regarding ChatGPT's data usage, including the lack of consent and a legal basis for collecting personal data.

Generative AI models are typically trained on internet data, ranging from individual posts and forum discussions to randomly filmed videos and art content. The article argues that being publicly accessible does not mean the contents are not "personal" or free to use without permission.

According to European GDPR rules, personal data can encompass anything that can be used to identify a person, even if it's publicly available. Companies should obtain consent from individuals, who are the owners of the data, before using it for any purpose. 

The artile, in general, advocates for the private sector to take appropriate measures to ensure responsible data scraping practices.

## Article 2
This article titled [*_POV: Big Tech has a glaring double standard when it comes to web scraping_*](https://www.fastcompany.com/90882752/pov-big-tech-has-a-glaring-double-standard-when-it-comes-to-web-scraping) takes on a more favorable view of data scraping, especially in the context of public interest research. The author depicts data scraping as a crucial tool for researchers to uncover issues such as disinformation. The article claims data privacy should not be the primary concern when used for legitimate research purposes and serves general public interests. 

Apart from researchers, data scraping is also frequently used among private and public companies to help them better understand their users, competitors, and the market at large. Unlike researchers, companies attain lucrative results from this practice. Though not explicitly, the article presents a disapproving undertone to companies wielding private data to generate profit. It implies that privacy should be a concern dependent on the ultimate goal of its use.
